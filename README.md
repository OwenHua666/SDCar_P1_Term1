Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I write code which detects lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images. Â 


List of files:
---
1. P1.ipynb (All the codes are in thin python notebook) 
2. Test Files (Image and Videos used in the lane detection)
3. Test Files Output (Output Image and videos from the code)
4. Write-up.pdf (A brief description about key concepts in the program explaining how I satisfied each requirement in the project rubric)

Instruction for running the code:
---
You can run the python notebook directly after you installed all the used python package. (Matlibplot, pillow, moviepi, opencv, and the other fuctional packages)
